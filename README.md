Hi, I'm David Espinoza (@despinoza800),

I'm passionate about Software Engineering, with particular interests in Java, C, and C++. I'm always seeking to
understand more about programming, algorithms, and efficient coding practices.

Currently, I'm pursuing an Associate's degree with an emphasis in Computer Science at Glendale Community College, 
as part of the Maricopa-ASU Pathway Program. I'm preparing to transfer to Arizona State University to complete my 
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Software Engineering. My learning goes beyond the classroom 
as I help other Computer Science students with code reviews and debugging.

I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects or any projects that challenge me and allow me to apply and
expand my software engineering skills.
